# Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Various Factors

## Background


The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."


### Interactive scatter plot using D3


Created a scatter plot using D3 to show the correlation between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.
